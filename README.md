# Unhandled Errors in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling in API routes.  The `bug.js` file shows a POST route that's susceptible to database errors and missing validation. The solution, `bugSolution.js`, provides the corrected code with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug Description
The `POST /users` route in `bug.js` creates a new user. However, it lacks error handling for:

1. **Database Errors:**  If the database operation fails (e.g., due to connection issues or constraint violations), the error is silently swallowed.
2. **Invalid User Input:** The code doesn't validate the user data before attempting to create the user in the database. This could lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption.

## Solution
`bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution, including error handling and input validation using a try-catch block, input sanitization, status codes and detailed error responses.
